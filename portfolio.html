    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! üëãüèª</p>
       <p> My name is Trym, and I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science: Design, Use, and Interaction at the University of Oslo. The program focused on developing and designing effective IT solutions that cater to users' needs. Additionally, it provided a solid foundation in general data and IT knowledge, equipping me with a diverse set of tools, methods, and expertise in the IT field. I am eager to apply this knowledge to future work and projects.</p>
        
       <p> I am passionate about creating excellent user experiences and aspire to contribute to the development of IT solutions that are not only effective but also enjoyable for all users. I thrive in team environments and enjoy the collaborative nature of project work.</p>
        
       <p> Currently, I am gaining valuable experience working in technical support for an alarm transfer company. On the side, I am actively pursuing further education through courses to enhance various IT skills, including full-stack development and machine learning.</p>
        
       <p> I am excited about the prospect of contributing to impactful projects that enhance user experiences. Let's explore how my academic background and evolving skills can bring a fresh perspective to your team and future endeavors! </p>
